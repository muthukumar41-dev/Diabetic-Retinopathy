# **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System**  

A deep learning-based application to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. This project utilizes a trained neural network model integrated into an interactive Streamlit interface for efficient and accurate predictions.

---

## **Features**  
- **Deep Learning Model**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras for high-accuracy classification.  
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly image selection and prediction through Streamlit.  
- **Healthcare Insights**: Offers actionable healthcare tips for diabetic retinopathy patients.  
- **Efficient Classification**: Focuses on detecting two categories: **Moderate** and **No Diabetic Retinopathy (No_DR)**.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:  
  - TensorFlow/Keras  
  - Streamlit  
  - PIL (Python Imaging Library)  
  - NumPy  
- **Model Training**: Includes techniques such as data augmentation and callbacks for optimization.

## **Installation and Setup**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetic-retinopathy-detection.git  
cd diabetic-retinopathy-detection  
```  

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed. Run the following:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### **3. Download the Model**  
Place the pre-trained model file `best_model.keras` in the project directory.  

### **4. Run the Application**  
Launch the Streamlit app:  
```bash  
streamlit run app.py  
```  

---

## **Usage**  
1. Select an image from the available categories: **Moderate** or **No_DR**.  
2. The model will predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy for the selected image.  
3. Healthcare tips will be provided if the prediction indicates a condition.  

---

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Images are resized and normalized to match the model's input format.  
2. **Model Training**:  
   - A CNN with multiple layers and optimizations was trained on the dataset to classify diabetic retinopathy.  
3. **Deployment**:  
   - The trained model is deployed through a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.  

---

## **Future Improvements**  
- Expand classification to include more categories (e.g., Severe, Proliferative).  
- Integrate additional datasets for enhanced accuracy.  
- Add support for bulk image uploads and predictions.
